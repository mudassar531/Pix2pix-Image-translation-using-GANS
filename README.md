# Pix2pix-Image-translation-using-GANS
In this project, I used **Pix2Pix GANs** to translate face photos into sketches and back! 🖼️✏️ With a dataset of 21,000 images, I trained models using **Pix2Pix** for paired data, **CycleGAN** for unpaired, and added **VAE** for smoother results. The result? Sharp, realistic face-sketch transformations! 🎨✨
